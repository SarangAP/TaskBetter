# When working on new features or implementing fixes, please create a new branch for that
# Our workflow will be feature/fix branch -> dev branch -> prod branch (Do not create a PR to prod)
# Before starting a new branch ensure you checkout to dev and pull latest changes as to avoid merge conflicts and overriding others' work
