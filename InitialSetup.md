# How to get our basic environment set up

# In VS Code (Or whichever IDE you prefer), git checkout InitialSetup and pull latest changes
# Check if you have Node.js installed or not by doing node -v in terminal, if you don't the LTS version can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en
# Once installed, run npm install (this will install all dependencies)
# Run cd task-better
# run npm start to start the local development server at localhost:3000 you may need to allow node through firewall - NOTE: It will be easier to work with git if you are in the root project directory when doing any git commands instead of "task-better"
